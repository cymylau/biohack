## About

The aim of this routine is to support my metabolic health, cardiovascular 
markers, hormone balance, inflammation control, and general wellbeing.

The timing has been structured to avoid mineral competition and to
improve fat soluble vitamin absorption.

This is not a guide for anyone else, nor is it a recommendation. This is 
what I take and why. I am not a doctor, seek your own professional advice.

## Supplement Overview and Rationale

### Vitamin D3 and Vitamin K2

Vitamin D3 functions as a hormone within the body and plays an important
role in immune regulation, insulin sensitivity, testosterone balance,
and inflammation control. Your previous level was adequate but not
optimal, so increasing intake supports improved metabolic and
cardiovascular health.

Vitamin K2 works alongside vitamin D3 to ensure calcium is directed into
bone rather than soft tissues. It also supports cardiovascular health
and may help improve lipid markers such as HDL and ApoA1.

These should always be taken with a meal containing fat to improve
absorption.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Omega 3 EPA and DHA

Omega 3 fatty acids support cardiovascular health, reduce inflammation,
and improve fat metabolism. They can also support brain health and may
reduce migraine frequency. Taking them with food improves tolerance and
absorption.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Boron

Boron supports vitamin D activation and helps regulate hormone binding
proteins such as SHBG. This may improve the availability of free
testosterone. It also contributes to inflammatory balance and bone
health.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Zinc

Zinc supports immune function, testosterone production, thyroid
function, and insulin signalling. It competes with other minerals for
absorption, so it is taken on alternate days and separated from
magnesium.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Turmeric, Ginger and Black Pepper

Curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, helps reduce inflammation and
oxidative stress. Black pepper enhances curcumin absorption. This
combination may support cardiovascular health, metabolic function, and
migraine prevention.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Magnesium Glycinate

Magnesium is involved in hundreds of enzymatic reactions including
energy production and glucose regulation. It also supports nervous
system regulation and sleep quality. Taking magnesium in the evening
supports relaxation and avoids competition with zinc.

## Practical Notes

Take breakfast supplements with a meal containing healthy fats such as
eggs, yoghurt, nuts, seeds, olive oil or avocado.

Avoid taking zinc at the same time as magnesium to reduce absorption
competition.

Magnesium is best taken in the evening to support sleep and recovery.

This plan is structured for consistency, absorption efficiency, and long
term metabolic support.
